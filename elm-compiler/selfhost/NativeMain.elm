module NativeMain exposing (main)

{-| M15: the node-free compiler driver — a pure `Runtime.program` Task app
that replaces `elm-compiler/run.js` for BOTH of its CLI shapes.

CLI (identical to run.js, minus the leading `node run.js`):

    elmc <input1.elm> [input2.elm ...] <output.csexp>
    elmc <manifest>

The manifest is LINE-ORIENTED (no Json.Decode in the selfhost corpus): one
source path per line; each group terminated by an output marker line.
tools/selfhost-gate.sh generates it from the gate's JSON manifest with

    jq -r '.groups[] | (.sources[] | .), "-> " + .output'

    <src1.elm>
    <src2.elm>
    -> <out1.csexp>
    <src3.elm>
    -> <out2.csexp>

A lone argument that is not `--batch`-like is treated as a manifest iff its
line 2 (or any later line) starts with "-> " — the single-group CLI shape
(a.b elm out.csexp) has no such line.  (`--batch` is accepted as a no-op
prefix for run.js symmetry; the manifest argument follows it.)

The fixed corpus (Prelude, Runtime, the 25 core-libs — run.js's exact order,
see corpusPaths) is compiled ONCE per process and every group compiles
against it, matching run.js's batch behavior byte for byte:
Lower.Module.compileBatch is called with the same corpus texts in the same
order and the same per-group source texts in the same order, and its output
is a pure function of those inputs.

I/O discipline: stdout stays CLEAN — the driver prints the final model (a
status line) after the effect loop drains.  Per-group compile failures land
in that group's OWN output file as "err <msg>" (run.js parity, so `head -c4
| grep '^err '` checks keep working).  Usage/manifest-level failures write
`err <msg>` to `elmc.err` in the CWD.

Env contract: ELMC_ROOT = repo root; the corpus is read from
$ELMC_ROOT/elm-compiler/.  When unset or empty the corpus root is the plain
relative path `elm-compiler` (paths resolve against the process CWD
everywhere else, matching run.js).  The process arguments arrive via
Runtime.argv () (the *argv* pseudo-global the driver installs — run.js
argv[2:] shape: the binary path is NOT an element).
