  )

-- M1 bubbletea-style core loop (charmbracelet/bubbletea's program loop,
-- subset-ported) over the M9 host Program substrate.  NOT an elm/core port —
-- this is fx-ui's terminal-UI runtime module, written in the subset the
-- checker accepts.
--
-- v2 (widgets-port S0): the app now receives Key AND Mouse events AND its own
-- messages (spinner ticks, etc.).  `Config msg model` names the app contract;
-- the app's `update` takes ITS OWN `msg`, produced by `onKey`/`onMouse` from a
-- decoded input or by the app's own commands.  The internal `FrameMsg` ADT
-- carries every host delivery (keys, mouse, resize, the user's own cmds mapped
-- back through `FUser`, quit, and side-effect ignores); `outerUpdate`
-- translates each into the app's message space and re-wraps the app's commands
-- with `Cmd.map FUser`.
--
-- Subset/architecture deviations from real bubbletea, all forced by the M9
-- cmd-driven loop and the checker surface:
--   * the input subscriptions are SELF-RE-ARMING TaskReadKey/TaskReadMouse
--     commands (the M9 loop delivers task results as the only messages; there
--     are no Subs) — every handled key re-arms `Io.readKey`, every handled
--     mouse event re-arms `Io.readMouse`, but quit and KeyEof/MouseEof do NOT:
--     KeyEof/MouseEof (stdin EOF) take the exit path directly and are never
--     delivered as normal input (a re-arm after them would spin — the host
--     completes every re-armed read with the EOF marker instantly once stdin
--     hits EOF);
--   * `view` returns List String (one string per terminal row) instead of a
--     full-screen view type (no String.split/`++` in the Prelude);
--   * quitting = appending `quit` (a [TaskQuit] command) to the command the
--     update returns; the payload-less Runtime.TaskQuit ctor is polymorphic in
--     BOTH Task params (Nothing : Maybe a class), so it inhabits any Cmd msg;
--     outerUpdate scans for it SYNCHRONOUSLY (ctor match, no equality) so the
--     readKey/readMouse re-arm is dropped on the quit event and the host's
--     eval set drains to zero (a delivery-time quit would leave a suspended
--     read and the program would hang waiting for one more event);
--   * the tea model is a plain record {mod, prev, rows, cols} — `mod` is the
--     user's model, `prev` the last SUBMITTED frame (skipRender's unchanged-
--     model guard), rows/cols the last resize dims; repaints address rows
--     ABSOLUTELY (\e[row;1H, host-side), so the cursor's
--     resting place between frames is irrelevant (and mosh's predictive local
--     echo, which parks the cursor anywhere, cannot derail a repaint);
--   * every frame is submitted as ONE TaskRender (the structured
--     Draw.Frame via Draw.fromAnsiLog) -> ONE host render(2): the HOST
--     TerminalRenderer (src/renderer/terminal.zig) diffs+paints with the
--     same per-row damage vocabulary (PTY-deterministic single-write
--     frames, byte-parity with the retired Elm-side paint).


{-| The app contract.  `init`/`update`/`view`/`resize` are the same shape as
v1, but `update` now takes the APP'S OWN message type (produced by `onKey`/
`onMouse` from a decoded input, or by the app's own commands) and returns
`Cmd msg` of that same type.  `mouse` picks the terminal tracking mode —
`MouseModeOff` arms no readMouse at all.

CLOSED-SUBSET VIEW CONTRACT: a `view` row is expected to carry ONLY the SGR
that Lipgloss renders emit.  Rows are re-parsed by Draw.fromAnsiLog into a
Draw.Frame before they cross to the host, so any ANSI an app embeds in a
view row is CANONICALIZED OR DROPPED: unknown SGR params (21/26/28/51..55/
58...) and no-op events vanish, attr-clear/set params replay in canonical
order, non-SGR escapes (OSC, other CSI) are eaten and never reach the
screen.  Hand-rolled escapes will NOT round-trip byte-for-byte — if you
need a style, emit it through Lipgloss (see Draw.fromAnsiLog for the full
contract).

{-| The messages `outerUpdate` handles.  `FKey`/`FMouse` carry a decoded
terminal input (translated through the app's onKey/onMouse); `FResize` the
cols/rows probe answered at startup and every live SIGWINCH; `FUser` the app's
own command deliveries (sleep ticks, etc.); `FQuit` a quit marker that escaped
the synchronous scan (defensive — the scan normally catches it first);
`FIgnored` the delivery of side-effect chains (frame writes, raw-mode flips,
mouse-mode flips).

contract).  GKey/GMouse carry the SAME decoded Key/MouseMsg values the
terminal readKey/readMouse leaves build, so the app's onKey/onMouse hooks
are unchanged; GResize carries the window size in CELLS; GClose is the
window-close / SDL-QUIT event; GIgnore marks a swallowed record (an unmapped
scancode or a filtered text byte) — re-armed, never delegated to the app.

{-| Turn a user config `Config msg model` into a host Program.  init batches
the user's initial command (mapped into FUser space) with a RAW-MODE-FIRST
chain per input leaf: raw mode must be ON before the winsize probe / first
readKey / first readMouse (the first frame's \r\n is mangled by the tty's ONLCR
otherwise — the host runs batched tasks out of spawn order, so ordering here is
a chain, not a batch).

The mouse arm (mouseMode + readMouse) is included ONLY when `config.mouse` is
not MouseModeOff — a readMouse armed with tracking off would sit on fd0 and
never complete.  Each is chained after rawMode like the key arm.

{-| The GUI twin of `program` (photon-gui P2): the SAME Config renders into
the host's SDL window instead of the terminal — apps switch backends at ONE
call site.  init arms guiOpen plus ONE self-re-arming guiPoll (the GUI
analogue of the rawMode->winSize->readKey(+mouse) chain); the window's first
event is the host's initial GResize at the real cell size, which triggers
the first paint.  The app-side view pipeline is UNCHANGED: `view` still
returns List String, and GUI mode feeds it through Draw.fromAnsi and
submits the STRUCTURED Frame to the host (TaskRender) — damage tracking and
presenting are host-side (rencache, dirty rects only).  (Since the P4
switch the TERMINAL path renders host-side too — the Elm-side
Tea.paint/diffString painter is retired; the two modes differ only in the
parser: plain fromAnsi here, the SGR-event-log fromAnsiLog on the terminal
seam.)  `config.mouse` is ignored: the window delivers mouse
events through guiPoll, so no tracking mode is armed.  Exit = GClose (window
close) or the app's quit, both via guiClose + the quit latch.

Fail-soft: without a window backend (-Dgui off) guiOpen/guiPoll complete
unit, the GUI branch treats that as a non-event, no re-arm fires, and the
program drains to exit instead of hanging.
