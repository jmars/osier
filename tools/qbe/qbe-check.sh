#!/usr/bin/env bash
# qbe-check.sh — the stage-1 verification runner (native-backend slice).
#
# For every slice fixture: compile BOTH ways from the same source, run the
# SAME entry with the same args on elmvm and on the native binary, and
# require IDENTICAL stdout.  Also runs the two crux checks:
#
#   * GC CHURN: rerun the native binary under a tiny QBE_HEAP_MB so the
#     moving collector runs constantly (the minimum viable heap, so every
#     allocation pressure point scavenges); output must still match.  This
#     is the behavioural proof that the pooled-frame roots actually root (a
#     promotion bug = silently stale pointers, not a crash).
#   * ROOT STORES SURVIVE: grep the emitted .s for stores/loads through the
#     pooled frame pointer (%rbx = rt_frame_enter's result) around the
#     recursive callq sites — the structural counterpart of the behavioural
#     check (a future qbe that starts promoting would show as 0).
#
#   * TAIL: a cross-defun tail fixture (mutual recursion) measures how deep
#     the native stack grows per hop vs the VM (ulimit-bounded).
#
# Usage: tools/qbe/qbe-check.sh    (exit 0 = all checks pass)
